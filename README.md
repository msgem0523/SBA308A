# 🧪 JavaScript Fundamentals Practice — SBA308

**Course Project** • Introductory JavaScript

This project was created as part of an early JavaScript assignment to practice **core language fundamentals** such as variables, functions, conditionals, and basic program flow.

The focus of this project is **logic and syntax**, not UI or styling.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project represents my early work while learning JavaScript.  
It demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to:

- Define variables and constants
- Write and call functions
- Use conditional statements
- Work through logical problems step by step
- Output results to the browser console

The project runs entirely in the browser and does not require any frameworks or libraries.

## 💻 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Core logic and problem-solving |
| **HTML** | Loads and runs the JavaScript file |

---

## 📁 Project Structure

├── index.html – Loads the JavaScript logic
├── index.js – JavaScript practice and exercises
└── README.md – Project documentation


---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. JavaScript logic is written in `index.js`
2. The HTML file loads the script
3. Output is displayed in the browser’s **Developer Console**
4. The project focuses on understanding how JavaScript executes line by line

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Open **Developer Tools**
3. Navigate to the **Console** tab to view output

No installation, build tools, or dependencies are required.

## 🧩 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

✔ JavaScript syntax and structure  
✔ Writing and calling functions  
✔ Using conditional logic  
✔ Debugging with the browser console  
✔ Understanding how scripts are executed
